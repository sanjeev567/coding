    <!-- 
        css-- cashcading style sheet 
        Basically three parts having in the css 
            1> selector
            2> property
            3> value
            P { color : blue;}
            here p is selector 
                color is property and 
                blue is the value
    Three ways to add css to the markup(html code)
        1> inline css -> <div style ="color blue " -> not recommended
        2> Internal css -> add style in the head tag  -> what happen if your style code is so longer think about it.
        3> External css -> another style sheet adding via link  -> this is the best way
